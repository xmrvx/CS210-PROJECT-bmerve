# CS210-PROJECT-bmerve
Motivation:
The motivation behind this heart rate analysis project stems from a desire for a deeper understanding of personal health and the factors influencing it. Heart rate data, a critical indicator of cardiovascular health, can reveal much about oneâ€™s lifestyle and well-being. By meticulously analyzing this data, the intent is to uncover patterns and correlations with daily behaviors, stress levels, quality of sleep, and physical activity. This exploration seeks to leverage data-driven insights to foster a more informed approach to health, potentially leading to better health decisions, improved fitness strategies, and a more personalized health regimen. The overarching aim is to utilize the power of personal data to support a proactive stance on health maintenance and preemptive care.

Hypothesis: There are significant, predictable fluctuations in heart rate based on the time of day and day of the week, which correlate with different levels of physical activity and rest. These fluctuations can be used to predict future heart rate patterns and potentially identify deviations that might indicate health issues or the need for lifestyle adjustments."
